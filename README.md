# SILVER - Statistical Independence and Leakage Verification (Transition Extended)

This repository contains the source code for the paper [SILVER - Statistical Independence and Leakage Verification](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/634.pdf) with the transitional leakage extension [Transitional Leakage in Theory and Practice - Unveiling Security Flaws in Masked Circuits]. 

## Features
SILVER is a framework written in C++ which particulary relies on Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs) and the concept of statistical independence of probability distributions. This framework allows to analyze and verify masked implementations (given as verilog design or instruction list) against the following security notions (using different security models as reference):
- Probing Security (standard / robust model including (glitches and transitions))
- Non-Interference Security (standard / robust model (only glitches))
- Strong Non-Interference Security (standard / robust model (only glitches))
- Probe-Isolating Non-Interference Security (standard / robust model (only glitches))
- Uniformity (of output sharing)

## Contact and Support
Please contact Pascal Sasdrich (pascal.sasdrich@rub.de) if you have any questions, comments, if you found a bug that should be corrected, or if you want to reuse the framework or parts of it for your own research projects.

## Build Instructions
Please follow the instructions below to build the SILVER framework:

1. Download and include the [Boost Graph Library (BGL)](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html).
2. Update the `BOOST` variable in the makefile with the path to your copy of BGL.
3. Clone and build the [Sylvan](https://github.com/trolando/sylvan) BDD library.
4. Copy (replace) the Sylvan library to `/lib/`
5. Copy (replace) the Sylvan header files to `/inc/sylvan/`
6. `make release`

## Quick Start
Build the SILVER framework using the instructions above. You can configure the framework via the [command line](#Command-line-options) to specify the number of cores and RAM used by Sylvan. Besides, you can enable Verilog parsing or parse instruction files directly (cf. examples in `test/`). If Verilog parsing is enabled, please specify necessary parameters in `/inc/config.hpp` and describe your cell library used during synthesis in `cell/` (example given for constrained NANG45).

1. `make release`
2. `./bin/verify`

```

Note that if you do not set `--verilog=1` then all other `--verilog-*` arguments will be ignored.

## Verilog annotations

The verification of all security notions implemented in SILVER is based on the correct identification of secret and random inputs. For this, SILVER expects additional annotations on any secret input and output signal indicating the corresponding sharing properties. Any other (non-secret) signal is considered as random.

### Synthesis (Synopsis Design Compiler)

The given examples are based on designs synthesized by NANG45 standard cell library and Synopsis Design Compiler. The following commands (for synthesis script) can be used to restrict the resulting netlist to only those cells which are supported by SILVER.

```
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/FA*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/HA*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/AOI*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/OAI*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/MUX*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/CLKBUF*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/OR3*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/OR4*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/OR5*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/NOR3*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/NOR4*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/NOR5*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/XNOR3*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/XNOR4*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/XNOR5*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/XOR3*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/XOR4*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/XOR5*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/AND3*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/AND4*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/AND5*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/NAND3*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/NAND4*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/NAND5*]
set_dont_use [get_lib_cells NangateOpenCellLibrary/BUF*]
```

The flowing commands can be used to force the synthesizer to compile, keep the hierarchy and make a flattened netlist of the design.

```
compile -map_effort medium -area_effort medium
compile_ultra -no_autoungroup
ungroup -all -flatten
```

If the netlist contains a loop, the decision whether the primary input or the feedback signal is given to the circuit must be performed by multiplexers while multiplexers are not allowed in the remaining combinational circuit.

### Synthesis (Yosys)

SILVER can also parse and evaluate the netlist generated by open-source synthesizer Yosys (http://www.clifford.at/yosys/). The generated netlist should be flattened and based on a certain library whose cells are supported by SILVER. As reference, we refer to folder 'Yosys' where an examplary synthesis script in addition to a customized library are given.

### Verilog attribute syntax

If verilog parsing is enabled, the parser will take care of the correct annotations for the internal circuit representation used by SILVER. However, for this, all input and output signals of the verilog module have to be annotated using custom attributes. In general, the annotation should use the following verilog syntax:

```
(* attribute *) input inputname;
/* ... */

(* attribute *) output outputname;
/* ... */
```

### SILVER attributes

In particular, the verilog parser will any attribute preceded by the SILVER keyword, i.e., follwing the syntax: `(* SILVER="attribute" *)`. In addition, the following different attributes are defined and recognized by the parser:

| attribute | description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| *clock*         | Keyword for identification of clock signals. |
| *control*       | Keyword for identification of control signals. |
| *refresh*       | Keyword for identification of fresh mask signals (i.e., random signals). |
| *Vn_Sn*         | Keyword for identification of a single shared signal (with Vn the variable number and Sn the share number) |
| *[Vn:Vm]_Sn*    | Keyword for identification of a shared vector with Vn to Vm -- either ascending or descending --  the variable numbers and Sn the share number) |
| *Vn_[Sn:Sm]*    | Keyword for identification of a shared vector with Vn the variable number and Sn to Sm -- either ascending or descending --  the share numbers) |

### Examples

In addition, different combination of the attributes are supported as well, for example:

```
(* SILVER="[3:0]_0" *)         input [3:0]  sboxIn1;
(* SILVER="[3:0]_1" *)         input [0:3]  sboxIn2;
(* SILVER="3_2,2_2,1_2,0_2" *) input [3:0]  sboxIn3;
(* SILVER="[3:0]_0" *)         output [3:0] share1;
(* SILVER="[3:2]_1,[1:0]_1" *) output [3:0] share2;
(* SILVER="3_2,[2:1]_2,0_2" *) output [3:0] share3;
(* SILVER="refresh" *)         input mask;
(* SILVER="clock" *)           input clk;
(* SILVER="control" *)         input rst;
```

### Attributes over time

By default, the *refresh* attribute generates a fresh mask and keeps it constant during the evaluation. To change random masks during particular clock cycles, the following attribute extensions are defined and recognized by the parser: 

| example | description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `(* SILVER="refresh" *)`                          | Attribute for setting a random mask which is constant during all evaluated cycles. |
| `(* SILVER="{refresh0},{refresh1}" *)`            | Attribute for setting a random mask for cycle 1 and new random mask for cycle 2 and following cycles. |
| `(* SILVER="{refresh0},{refresh1},{refresh0}" *)` | Attribute for reusing the random mask from cycle 1 during cycle 3 and following cycles. |

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you may encounter during execution along with possible fixes.

### Shared libraries (libsylvan.so)
In case you get an error message similar to: 

```
./bin/verify: error while loading shared libraries: libsylvan.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

please export the `/lib` directory to your linker library path, e.g., using `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=``pwd``/lib` before executing the binary.

Note that you may get a similar error referring to `libboost_program_options.so`. You will need to add the path to your boost installation to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. E.g. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BOOST/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

### Cache creation (memory allocation)
In case you get an error message similar to: 

```
cache_create: Unable to allocate memory: Cannot allocate memory!
```

please decrease the memory size provided in `inc/config.hpp` according to your available system memory.
